    "Hey there! I’m the kind of guy who keeps a <b>cool head</b>, no matter the situation — I find it hard to hold grudges and I always value <b>transparency</b> and <b>trust</b>. This approach not only makes life more pleasant but also smooths the way in professional settings. And when I’m not at my desk, you might find me <b>skydiving</b>; I’m almost licensed and love the <b>thrill</b> it brings!<br/><br/>I’ve got a pretty hefty tech stack under my belt, having built over <b>35 mobile, 3 web and 6 backend apps</b>, all with tools like <b>Kotlin, Swift, ReactJS, NodeJS, and Golang</b>. I’m also deep into <b>AI</b>, working with technologies like <b>ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Midjourney, and Bard</b> to create smarter workflows in <b>development, testing, and documentation</b>.<br/><br/>Leading teams? That’s where I really step up. I’ve led more than <b>30 engineers</b>, driving discussions on <b>architecture</b> and <b>system design</b>, setting <b>best practices</b>, and designing efficient <b>git flows</b> and <b>documentation strategies</b>. Plus, I’ve crafted <b>recruitment pipelines</b> and <b>assessment processes</b> that not only fill positions but ensure everyone’s on board with our key <b>values</b>.",
